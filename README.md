#These are my dotfiles  
Since I have no clue what to do with my dotfiles there is not much to see
right now.  
Anyhow, it's trmendously important to have all these files version controlled 
and remotely accessible on all my machines. I can't even wrap my mind around
how much word it'd be to rewrite all this.

###Thanks
